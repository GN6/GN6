Hello! I’m @GN6, a current (Jan. 17th, 2025) high school student with a passion for competitive programming. I began my competitive programming journey in January of 2022 by joining my school's programming team with zero experience. Since then, I've self-studied competitive programming and have shattered school records. In addition, I took a role in coaching my peers on the lessons I've learned and the knowledge I've gained on my journey.

If you would like to contact me, please do so through my email: todawernher@gmail.com
